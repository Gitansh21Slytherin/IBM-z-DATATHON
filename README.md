Problem Statement:
Description of the Project:
Through this project we aim to analyse different weather conditions for farming various crops and make clusters of the crops that grow in similar weather conditions. 
We aim to do multi class classification and prediction to figure out which crop can be grown with the given conditions and the clustering. This will help the farmers to produce better yield and varied range of crops.



This repository contains the source code of the project work from past 24 hours.
The Jupyter Notebook contains:
1. Descriptive Analysis of the Agriculture Data.
    i)checking summary of crops such as average of various parameters.
    ii)summary statistics of indivisual crop. using Interactive function to choose.
    iii)Average requirnment for each crop with given conditions.

2. Analysis of different agcriculture
    i)conditions using disc plot

3. categories the crop based on season clustering similar kind of crops
    using hard and soft clustering techniques.

4. Finding out any hiding Patterns in the Dataset.

5. Predictive Modeling.
